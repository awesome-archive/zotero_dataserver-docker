# Docker image for a Zotero Data Server

This image was build following the instructions for installing a Zotero dataserver at (http://git.27o.de/dataserver/about/), which is an updated procedure of [this document](https://github.com/Panzerkampfwagen/dataserver/blob/master/misc/Zotero_Data_Server_Installation_Debian.pdf).


## Build the image

    docker build -t zotero .

The resulting image is configured run a dataserver on https://localhost/.

To customize the installation the following files must be edited:
* SSL certificate: apache/zotero.{cert,key}. The current certificate is self-signed for localhost.
* Apache site config: apache/sites-zotero.conf. 
* Dataserver: dataserver/config.inc.php. To match the site config.
* MySQL credentials/passwords: mysql/setup\_db and dataserver/dbconnect.inc.php accordingly.

The build procedure also creates a couple of test users: test:test and test2:test2.


## Start the dataserver

    docker run  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -t -i zotero

This will start the dataserver on https://localhost/ 

    https://localhost/sync/login?version=9&username=test&password=test

because of the self-signed certificate some browsers may refuse to connect the server.


## Patch the standalone client to use the new dataserver

We follow the procedure of (http://git.27o.de/dataserver/about/Zotero-Client.md).
Download the Zotero client, and change these two lines in resource/config.js inside the zotero.jar archive (zip)

    SYNC_URL: 'https://localhost/sync/',
    API_URL: 'https://localhost/',

If the server uses a self-signed certificate an exception should be added to the client. A cert\_override.txt file must added to the local profile generated by zotero client:

    ~/Library/Application\ Support/Zotero/Profiles/[something].default/      MAC
    ~/.zotero/Profiles/[something].default/                                  Linux
    c:Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/Zotero/Zotero/                        Win

The cert\_override.txt file can be generated with Firefox following (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/zotero-dev/MEwLaptJIzI/PVDAFJiqEgAJ)


## Admin users 

    cd /srv/zotero/dataserver/admin 
    ./add_user 101 testuser  testpassword
    ./add_user 102 testuser2 testpassword2
    ./add_group -o testuser -f members -r members -e members testgroup 
    ./add_groupuser testgroup testuser2 member 

add\_user is a patched version of the original script at git.27o.de that allows to set the password from the command line.
